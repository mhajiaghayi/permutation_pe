it implements the encoding and failure recovery of the permutation code based on the Jafar's paper on permutational code and our modified scheme. 
 
 It returns the recovery time vs the number of participating nodes. The total
 size of data is fixed while changinplease refer to this paper for more details https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06927. 

Here we have borrowed some GF functionality from the GF implementation in http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/papers/CS-13-704.tar.
